On December 20, Projectivity Group received the Emerging Artist Award presented by Historic Tappen Park Community Partnership. The event took place at Stapleton's new COFFEED at Urby. The award acknowledged our contributions and efforts to help provide education and resources to anyone interested in the arts. While only a few of us attended the event I thought it was important to recognize some of the artists and hard workers that make up Projectivity. Without these people, Projectivity would still be just an idea. Thank you Dave Noodlez and Stereotype Co., Vernon 'Dyverse' Wooten, Kwue Molly, John Exit, Magie Serpica and Milk and Honey Tattoo Parlour, Cody Prez Nwc, Braze1, Caster Otm, Chris Rwk Chillemi and Kevin Mahoney of RWK, Scott Van Campen and DB Lampman of SI MakerSpace, Taiwan DjShame Moss, Josh Glazer, Paul Marz, Brent Kaufman, Kenneth Paul Graham and Kimbra Eberly and Hub 17 NYC, Ed Pollio and Angelica Popolano of 5050 Skatepark, Monica Valenzuela and Gena Mimozo of Staten Island Arts, Mike Shane, Charlie Rock and William Starda Perry, ErinKelli Kilbane, Stephanie Kosinski, Scott James and Trunkface, Matty Jacob and Knot Lion Media, Tariq Zaid and Richmond Hood Company, The Higher Concept and EVERYONE that contributed to the Musication series, and others which I am likely forgetting (I apologize). These individuals and groups have shown tremendous support over the years and made the collective what it is today. Projectivity and the SI art scene as a whole would not be here without the amazing contributions of all these hard workers.
