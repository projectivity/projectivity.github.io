This summer of 2016, Staten Island Arts hosted a series of freestyle writing workshops introducing students to creative writing and spoken word. The series culminated with an Open Mic which took place at the Staten Island Arts' Culture Lounge at SI Ferry. Projectivity helped some students record their written pieces in the recording studio and also helped film the final open mic. This program was supported in part with funding from The Donald and Shelley Rubin Foundation. #ProjectYourself
