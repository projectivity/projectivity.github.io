4th Annual Musication was a huge success! More than 200 people attended the video game tournament/art auction. Over $2,000 was raised to go towards the Lark Fund on Staten Island, which offers mini-grants to public schools on Staten Island for instrument repairs, art supplies, and other programming around the arts. Thanks so all our sponsors for making it such a successful event!
