Projectivity teaching artists worked with the youth and parents at Faber Park to introduce them to music, video, fashion, and art. The open house was sponsored by SICPP, MetroPlus Health Plan, and NYC Parks. To bring Projectivity to your school, agency, or venue contact us at ProjectivityGroup@gmail.com.
