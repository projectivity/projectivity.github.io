Richmond Hood Co's annual block party was in full effect this year with twice the wall space (over 6000 square ft) of public art. Despite the rain, artists came out to beautify Castleton Ave. Make sure to stop by and see the work in person. Thanks so all the artists that showd up to paint on the walls and on the fence:
