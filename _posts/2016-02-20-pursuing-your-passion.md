Projectivity attended the 2016 Island Voice Youth Summit at Wagner College on Staten Island. Our intern Will DeLisi teamed up with Stereotype Co. and interviewed some of the successful business owners, teachers, entrepreneurs, and students about how they are following their dreams and pursing their passions. The footage was edited by Will DeLisi at Hub17 for Projectivity.
