The "ColorBlind" mural was designed by artist Kwue Molly, meant to showcase diversity and unity inside of our communities.  The idea was to have local residents help paint flags that represent the different nationalities in their neighborhood.  This is the 3rd "ColorBlind" mural in NYC, which was funded by the NY Citizens Committee and organized by Projectivity in collaboration with the Stapleton Public Library.  To have this mural painted in your community, contact ProjectivityGroup@gmail.com.
