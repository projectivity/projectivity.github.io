New event series "Scratch n Spit" features upcoming DJs and emcees. Starting off with a DJ workshop hosted by Stefan Barone and platinum producer Calogero, the event aims to educate amateurs on how to elevate their craft. We end the day in a live cypher featuring some of the talent that came through.
