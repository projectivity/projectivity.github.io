With help from the New York Citizen's Committee, Projectivity helped beautify a local wall in Stapleton, Staten Island. Artists [@KwueMolly](www.instagram.com/kwuemolly), [@Fumeroism](www.instagram.com/fumeroism), [@ScrammbledEggsit](www.instagram.com/scrambledeggsit), and [@TekstTHC](www.instagram.com/tekstthc) from Projectivity all came together with help from the community. This wall is directly across from [@FreshestLibrary](www.instagram.com/freshestlibrary) in Stapleton. Music by [@JGlazeProductions](www.instagram.com/jglazeproductions)
